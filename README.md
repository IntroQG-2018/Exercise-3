# Exercise 3: Hillslope diffusion

The objective of this week's exercise is to compute hillslope profiles assuming hillslope evolution is a diffusive process.
As discussed in lecture, the hillslope diffusion model is based on the principal of conservation of mass, which states that the changes in surface elevation are proportional to the soil/sediment flux along the hillslope.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where you are asked.

- **Exercise 3 is due by the start of class on on 19.11.**
- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg.github.io/qg/lessons/L3/exercise-3.html) if you're having trouble.
- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.

This tutorial is based on [a MATLAB exercise from Prof. Todd Ehlers (Uni TÃ¼bingen)](http://www.mnf.uni-tuebingen.de/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/mineralogie-geodynamik/forschungsbereich/geologie-geodynamik/workgroup.html).
